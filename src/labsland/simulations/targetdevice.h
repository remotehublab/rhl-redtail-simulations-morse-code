     *
     * These simulations work interacting with a number of devices (e.g., different types of FPGAs, microprocessors and such).
     *
     * These devices have different GPIOs and they are assigned to different numbers.
     *
     * To make the development easier, we have this class. We will later have a class implementing each real device, without
     * having to change the code of the simulations.
     *
     * The design is the following:
     *
     * a) Every device has a set of GPIOs. By default, some are input, some are output. 
     * b) Some simulations might change this (e.g., turn an input into an output) in very specific cases.
     * c) Simulations will allocate a number of input GPIOs for themselves, and a number of output GPIOs for themselves.
     * d) This class will have to take care of everything else.
     *
     * For example:
     *
     * a) A device has 14 outputs (e.g., GPIO0-GPIO5 and GPIO10-GPIO17) and 4 inputs (e.g., GPIO6-GPIO9). By default this is it.
     *
     * b) Additionally, a device has a set of GPIOs that are tagged as "for-simulation", in a specific order. 
     *    For example, maybe there is a relay that depending on the configuration, a pin of the target device will be connected to 
     *    a motor or to GPIO15. If the designer of the board wants to guarantee that the GPIO15 is not used in the board, what he would
     *    typically do is to set that the simulation gpios are GPIO17-GPIO16, GPIO14-GPIO10 in this order.
     *
     * c) A particular simulation allocates 5 of the outputs and 2 of the inputs.
     *
     *    The simulation therefore will get GPIO17, GPIO16, GPIO14, GPIO13, GPIO12 for output, and GPIO8-GPIO9 for inputs.
     *
     *    This means that if the user requests "turn gpio 10 on" (e.g., with a switch), it will work, because it is not allocated by the
     *    simulation, so those GPIOs will still work. But if the user requests "turn gpio 12 on", it will not work, because the GPIO12
     *    is already assigned to the simulation, and instead will return an error.
     *
     * d) Additionally, a simulation might allocate named inputs and outputs. For example, certain well known names (and only those)
     *    can be allocated. This only happens with specific protocols (e.g., custom serial, i2c, spi, etc.), where the board might want
     *    to allow specific names for that.
     *
     * e) Finally, it is sometimes possible to request a superior number of inputs or outputs that there actually is, and the TargetDevice,
     *    if possible, will reassign certain inputs as outputs and viceversa. This will only happen in some boards and in specific pins.
     *
     *
     * Important: simulations will be able to know in advance if a target device works or not.
